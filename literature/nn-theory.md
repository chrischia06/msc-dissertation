+ "However, a less known but powerful result is that a NN with a single hidden layer can accurately approximate any nonlinear continuous operator."
+ "We demonstrate that DeepONet can learn various explicit operators, such as integrals and fractional Laplacians, as well as implicit operators that represent deterministic and stochastic differential equations"
