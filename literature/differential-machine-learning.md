# Differential Machine Learning

These papers center around incorporating differentials (first order or higher) in the loss function of a neural network. Brian Huge and Antoine Savine described in the context of derivatives modelling for pricing risks.

**ERIK ALEXANDER ASLAKSEN JONASSON, Differential Deep Learning for Pricing Exotic Financial Derivatives (2021)**
+ Student Paper
+ Based somewhat on Geirsson, “Deep learning exotic derivatives” which is also a student paper
+ Product: Autocallables
+ Transfer Learning: using differential machine learning has on the generalization error when using neural networkspre-trained on one autocall contract and retraining them to fit a new autocall contract

**Geirsson, Deep learning exotic derivatives (2021)**
+  Master’s thesis
+ Focus on Autocallables
+ Finds that swish activation works best
