# Deep Hedging

**Summary**: 

+ Use a neural network as an approximation for a hedging strategy. Buehler et al popularised the idea in their paper "Deep Hedging". 
+ This can be thought of as semi-supervised learning, or reinforcement learning, although not in the sense of Q-learning or other RL methods. 
+ In terms of derivatives pricing, this can be viewed as pricing via replication in an incomplete, discrete time version of some volatility / market model. 
+ Sensitivities can be obtained by automatic differentiation of the neural network (i.e. MC pathwise differentials). 
+ However, both pricingn aand sensitivities these require simulation of MC paths, making it likely too slow for pricing / risk applications. 
+ However, the strategy may be more optimal than a model hedge. Furthermore, the hedging strategy can account for transaction costs, and high dimensionality.
+ In Buehler et al Deep Hedging, they provide examples for only fixed vol model parameters (e.g. rho, vol-of-vol, kappa, theta in Heston), but this approach can likely be extended to account for multiple vol model parameters
