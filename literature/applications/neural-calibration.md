## Black-Scholes Implied Volatility

**Tae-Kyoung Kim, Hyun-Gyoon Kim, Jeonggyu Huh, Large-scale online learning of implied volatilities (2022)**

+ Ill-posed problem  - "the problem has a fundamentally ill-posed property in the domain where Vega is too small (Stefanica & Radoičić, 2017). In the low-Vega domain, small changes in the input (option price) can result in large changes in the target value (implied volatility). The authors of these previous studies were either satisfied with low accuracy or narrowed the input domain to alleviate the problem. However, these limitations prevent the adoption of networks in practice."

+ Leverage pyvollib for implied volatility computations http://vollib.org/documentation/python/1.0.2/
+ Compare against Jackel 2015 formula

+ "Generally, ANNs are not accurate when functions with steep gradients need to be approxi-
mated. Therefore, we need to adapt the requested output function. In order to obtain the
implied volatility from the option prices, we need to employ the gradient-squashing technique
as proposed in [2]. We subtract the intrinsic value from the American option price to obtain the corresponding time value"

+ Get parameters of market (volatility) model and use it to price exotics
+ Prices (or vol surface) of exotics need to be consistent with vanillas
+ "We create a neural network where the inputs are the volatility surface points and the exotic option parameters and the target is the price."
