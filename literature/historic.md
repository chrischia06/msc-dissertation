+ One of the first papers
+ RBF as activation function, RBFs have "best" approximation property Girosi and Poggio (1990), 1 layer hidden neural network
+ Applied on market data (S&P 500)
+ Exploits homogeneity to eliminate one of S, K. In their experiment, sigma appears to be fixed.
+ Considers R^{2} as a metric, and hedge analysis
