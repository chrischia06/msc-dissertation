# Rational Pricing

*Remark*: So-called 'rational pricing' is obtained by, which guarantees some no-arbitrage conditions for European Calls. Seems to be more of a CS based approach, usually evaluated on real S&P500 Options data from OptionMetrics.

+ can be calibrated to prices
+ The gated neural network satisfies some of the no-arbitrage constraints, in particular the right gradient signs
+ The multi-model is softmax + many gated models, sort of like an ensemble model
+ The gated and modular networks do not actually satisfy the intrinsic value bounds and exercise value equivalence at $\tau = 0$. The author's solution is to generate more data samples with $\tau = 0, K = 0$, sort of like importance sampling
+ Experiment Methodology: NNs are trained using last 5 days , calibration for BS / vol-models are done using the last day. Pricing error between real market prices and model prices for the next day are then evaluated under all models. *Remark*: This may be in effect equivalent to evaluating the explained PNL, or 1-day hedging error of the models, given that BS / vol-models would likely be used to recalibrate every trade as opposed to per day.
+ Single gated network has the worst results in the author's own experiment, but multi-model has the best. Suggests that ensembling is effective.
