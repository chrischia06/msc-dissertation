# Risk-Neutral / Transition Density

These papers focus on using deep learning to learn a risk-neutral or transition density. Similarly, we could consider modelling the CDF (equivalently, the value of a European digital option).  Given a valid transition density, we can recover all European calls through numerical integration.
